        <p>Detects unused variables in Robot Framework test files.</p>

        <p>
            This inspection helps identify unnecessary variables that are defined but never used.
            This can lead to cleaner code and reveal potential errors caused by typos in variable names.
        </p>

        <p>Example:</p>
        <pre><code>
*** Variables ***
${USED_VARIABLE}      Hello
${UNUSED_VARIABLE}    World    # will be marked as unused

*** Test Cases ***
Example Test
    Log    ${USED_VARIABLE}
</code></pre>

        <p>
            The inspection checks both global variables from the Variables section and local variables
            defined in test cases or keywords.
        </p>

            This inspection can help keep code cleaner by removing redundant variable definitions.
            This improves readability and maintainability of Robot Framework tests.
