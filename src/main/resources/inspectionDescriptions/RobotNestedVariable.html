        Detects nested variable syntax in Robot Framework files that reduces code readability and maintainability.

        <p>
            Nested variables like <code>${${variable_name}}</code> create complex expressions that are difficult to understand
            and debug. This pattern makes test cases harder to maintain and can lead to parsing issues in different
            Robot Framework versions.
        </p>

        <p>
            The inspection helps identify opportunities to refactor complex variable references into simpler,
            more readable alternatives that follow clean code principles.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example of problematic code:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
*** Variables ***
${ENV}         prod
${PROD_URL}    https://prod.example.com
${DEV_URL}     https://dev.example.com

*** Test Cases ***
Test Login
    # Nested variable - hard to read and maintain
    Open Browser    ${${ENV}_URL}

    # Better alternative - explicit and clear
    ${target_url}=    Set Variable If    '${ENV}' == 'prod'    ${PROD_URL}    ${DEV_URL}
    Open Browser    ${target_url}
</code></pre>

        <p>Text after this comment will only be shown in the settings of the inspection.</p>

        <p>Consider using conditional logic, keyword arguments, or separate test data files to eliminate nested variable patterns and improve code clarity.</p>
