        Reports usage of the deprecated 'WITH NAME' suffix in Robot Framework library imports.
        <p>
            The 'WITH NAME' suffix was deprecated in Robot Framework 6.0.0 and should be replaced with the 'AS' suffix for better consistency and readability.
        </p>
        <p>
            Example of deprecated syntax:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Library    MyLibrary    WITH NAME    MyLib</code></pre>
        <p>
            Should be replaced with:
        </p>
        <pre><code>Library    MyLibrary    AS    MyLib</code></pre>
        <!-- tooltip end -->
        <p>This inspection only triggers when Robot Framework version 6.0.0 or higher is detected in your project.</p>
