            Reports positional arguments that match the name of a reserved Robot Framework variable but are written as plain text instead of as a variable.
        </p>

        <p>
            This inspection detects cases where a single literal constant in an argument has the same name as a reserved variable
            (for example <code>${TEMPDIR}</code>, <code>${EXECDIR}</code>) but is used without the variable syntax.
            Such usage is often a typo or misunderstanding and may cause the test to use a hardcoded string instead of the intended dynamic value.
        </p>

        <p><b>Examples:</b></p>

        <pre><code># False (likely unintended usage)
Log    TEMPDIR

# False (likely unintended usage)
Create Directory    EXECDIR

# True (intended usage with reserved variables)
Log    ${TEMPDIR}

# True (intended usage with reserved variables)
Create Directory    ${EXECDIR}
    </code></pre>

        <p>
            The inspection only considers single-child positional arguments that are literal constants and compares them
            case-insensitively against the set of known reserved variables.
            If a match is found, it highlights the argument to help you replace it with the correct variable form.
