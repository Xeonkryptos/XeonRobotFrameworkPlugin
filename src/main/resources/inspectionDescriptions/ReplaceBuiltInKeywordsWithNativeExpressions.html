        Detects legacy built-in keywords that can be replaced with modern native Robot Framework conditional structures.

        <p>
            Robot Framework provides native conditional syntax (such as <code>IF</code>, <code>ELSE IF</code>, and <code>ELSE</code> blocks)
            that are more readable and maintainable than older built-in keywords like <code>Run Keyword If</code>.
            This inspection helps modernize test code by identifying opportunities to replace deprecated control flow keywords
            with their native equivalents.
        </p>

        <p>
            Using native conditional structures improves code clarity, reduces nesting complexity, and makes test cases easier to maintain.
            They also provide better integration with modern Robot Framework IDE features and debugging tools.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example of problematic code using legacy keywords:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
*** Test Cases ***
Legacy Conditional Test
    Run Keyword If    ${condition}    Log    Condition is true
    ...    ELSE IF    ${other_condition}    Log    Other condition is true
    ...    ELSE    Log    No condition was true
</code></pre>

        <p>
            The inspection suggests replacing this with the modern native syntax:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
*** Test Cases ***
Modern Conditional Test
    IF    ${condition}
        Log    Condition is true
    ELSE IF    ${other_condition}
        Log    Other condition is true
    ELSE
        Log    No condition was true
    END
</code></pre>

        <!-- tooltip end -->
        <p>
            <strong>Note:</strong> Other cases like for TRY-EXCEPT-FINALLY are also supported and handled by this inspection.
        </p>

        <p>
            The quick fix will automatically convert the legacy keyword syntax to the equivalent native conditional structure,
            ensuring that the logic and behavior remain unchanged while improving code readability.
