        Reports unused imports in Robot Framework files that clutter the code and reduce maintainability.

        <p>
            Unused imports make test files harder to read and understand by introducing unnecessary dependencies.
            They can also slow down test execution and create confusion about which resources are actually needed.
        </p>

        <p>
            This inspection helps maintain clean, minimal imports by identifying library, resource, and variable file
            imports that are declared but never referenced in the test suite.
        </p>

        <p>
            Example of problematic code:
        </p>
        <pre><code>
*** Settings ***
Library           SeleniumLibrary
Library           RequestsLibrary    # Not used anywhere
Resource          common_keywords.robot
Resource          unused_resource.robot    # Not used anywhere
Variables         config.py
Variables         unused_vars.py    # Not used anywhere

*** Test Cases ***
Test Example
    Open Browser    http://example.com    chrome

</code></pre>

        <p>Text after this comment will only be shown in the settings of the inspection.</p>

        <p>Remove unused imports to keep your Robot Framework files clean and focused on the actual test requirements. This improves code readability and reduces maintenance overhead.</p>
