        <p>Reports keyword calls and variable usages whose name (case-insensitive) deviates from the declared name by adding, removing or replacing underscores or spaces.</p>

        <p>
            The inspection compares for keyword calls the actually declared name of a user-defined Robot Framework keyword or a Python keyword (respecting a custom @keyword decorator) with the spelling used in the test. Differences caused solely by inserting, deleting, collapsing or expanding segments via underscores (_) or spaces are highlighted. For variables a cleaned base name (without syntactic wrapper) is compared so that inconsistent underscore/space formatting becomes visible.
        </p>

        <p>
            Typical triggers:<br/>
            - Added or removed underscores.<br/>
            - Replaced underscores with spaces (or vice versa).<br/>
            - Condensed or split parts of a name.<br/>
            - Mixing spaces and underscores differing from the declaration.
        </p>

        <p>
            Pure differences in letter case are ignored. No quick fix is provided; names must be adjusted manually.
        </p>

        <p>Examples:</p>
        <pre><code>*** Keywords ***
My Sample Keyword
    Log    Hello World

*** Variables ***
${API_TOKEN_VALUE}    secret123

*** Test Cases ***
Demo
    # Keyword call with extra underscores -> warning, expected: My Sample Keyword
    My_Sample_Keyword

    # Keyword call with multiple spaces -> warning
    My  Sample   Keyword

    # Variable with spaces instead of underscores -> warning, expected: ${API_TOKEN_VALUE}
    Log    ${API TOKEN VALUE}

    # Variable with removed underscore -> warning
    Log    ${API_TOKENVALUE}
</code></pre>

        <p>
            This check helps detect typos and inconsistent naming early and improves readability and maintainability of Robot Framework files.

            Notes:<br/>
            - Python keywords with a custom decorator name are validated against the decorator value.<br/>
            - Python keywords without a custom decorator name are validated against their own name.<br/>
            - User-defined Robot keywords are validated against their name.<br/>
            - Variables are compared via their base name (without syntactic markers).
