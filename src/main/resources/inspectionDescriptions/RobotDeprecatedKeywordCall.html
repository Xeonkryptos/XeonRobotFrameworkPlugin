        Reports keyword calls that reference deprecated keywords or library functions.
        <p>
            This inspection detects when a keyword call in Robot Framework references a keyword
            that has been marked as deprecated. Deprecated keywords are typically outdated and
            may be removed in future versions of the library or framework.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using deprecated keywords can lead to compatibility issues when upgrading libraries
            or the Robot Framework itself. It is recommended to replace deprecated keyword calls
            with their suggested alternatives.
        </p>
        <p>Example of a deprecated keyword call:</p>
        <pre><code>
*** Test Cases ***
Example Test
    Deprecated Keyword    argument1    argument2
</code></pre>
        <!-- tooltip end -->
        <p>
            The inspection checks keyword calls against their resolved references and highlights
            those that are marked with deprecation annotations or decorators (e.g., @deprecated
            in Python libraries).
